# Kafka Concepts and Flowcharts  

This repository contains detailed explanations of Kafka components and processes, along with flowcharts illustrating their functionality.

## Kafka  

**Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It is designed for high-throughput, low-latency messaging between applications and services.

## Key Kafka Concepts  

### 1. **Producer**  
A **Producer** is a client application that publishes messages to Kafka topics. Producers are responsible for sending data to the appropriate topic partitions.

### 2. **Consumer**  
A **Consumer** is a client application that reads messages from Kafka topics. Consumers belong to Consumer Groups for parallel data processing.

### 3. **Broker**  
A **Broker** is a Kafka server that stores and serves data. Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

### 4. **Cluster**  
A **Cluster** is a group of Kafka brokers working together. It handles the distribution of topics, partitions, and messages for high availability.

### 5. **Topic**  
A **Topic** is a category or feed name to which records are sent by producers. Topics are divided into partitions for scalability.

### 6. **Partitions**  
**Partitions** are the segments of a topic. Each partition is an ordered sequence of records that Kafka writes to and reads from.

### 7. **Offset**  
An **Offset** is a unique identifier assigned to each message within a partition. It helps consumers keep track of which messages have been processed.

### 8. **Consumer Groups**  
**Consumer Groups** allow multiple consumers to collaborate on processing data from a topic. Each partition in a topic is assigned to only one consumer in a group at a time.

### 9. **Zookeeper**  
**Zookeeper** is a coordination service used by Kafka to manage cluster metadata, monitor broker health, and facilitate leader election for partitions.
